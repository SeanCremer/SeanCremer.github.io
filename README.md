# Welcome to MSSQL Playpen

As the name suggests, MSSQL Playpen is a place to present concepts and ideas around working with Microsoft SQL Server in a fun way.  Some topics covered will be extremely complex while others very introductory.  Most of the topics covered will be realted to my experiences over the years and hopefully some of them will be usefull to others.

That being said thre is no reason why we will not include anything of interest on the IT front.  Sugestions for topics can be sent to <SeanACremer@Gmail.com>
