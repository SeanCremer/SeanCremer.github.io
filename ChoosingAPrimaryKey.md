## Introduction

Choosing the right Primary Key for a SQL table would seem to the laymen to be a very simple thing to do. In reality there are many things that you need to ask yourself about the data, the design as well as intended use.

Essentially the Primary key on a table is the mechanism through which SQL searches for the data you are looking for.  It has impact on anything you would want to do with the Table; inserting, updating, deleting or just plain joining to the table. 

For more information on the principals of Databse design you can refer to a previous post on [Introduction to Database Design](IntroductionToDatabaseDesign.md).

## Some Fundamental Truths

There are some rules that govern creating primmary key values on SQL server tables.  These rules are based around the reality that a Primary Key is in actual fact a constraint

### What are some of the Gotchas

- A Microsoft SQL Server Table can have only one Primary Key. (As they say in the movie Highlander, "There can e only one") 
- All columns that are added to a Primary Key cannot be nullable.  They wil be created not Nullable if you fail to specify that they are Not Nullable.
- If you did not realise it by now, it is by it very definition an Index that must have a unique value for each row in the table. If the chosen columns do not produce uniqueness, you cannot make it a Primmary Key.

## Some Simple Real World realities

Primary key columns can be any of the main SQL data types including strings. Each of the possible data types has consequences when chosen and implications when developing against them.  Cutting to the chase just beacuse a partiicular data type can be made into a primary key does not mean it is a good idea.

### Integers

Integers are your friend.  If you are designing a new database you should as best as posible try and make all your Primary Keys integers. Internally under the hood SQL server is able to work with Integers faster than other data types in nearly every implmeted design. They allow for faster joins between tables, improved lookups and smaller Phsycial volume indexes which improves the performnce of the index itself.

### Dates

I have unfortunately seen this in production quite often on various systems. Mostly on systems where people have called me to come and help them out with their database performance problems.  In a very simple like for like comparison an Integer is stored in 4 Bytes a DateTime in 8 bytes.  This naturally means you have doubled the size of reading volume for the index by using a date than would have been the case with an Integer. If your system is heavly transaction choosing a DateTime column for a Primary key is usually a done under the misguided belief that it would help out when writing reports that query the system on date ranges.

DateTime fileds are better suited to additional helper Indexes but not the Primary Key.  If you are adamant in your approach to wanting a date range searchable primary key then consider turning it into an Integer representation of the Date.  This can be something similar to interanl storage value whihc actually has very little meaning when visually seen or just make the date 2017-01-01  equal the Integer 20170101.  This will allow you to maintain your search options.  

Still at the very least in my experience it is not a good idea to use date,  I would strongly advise against it if you want a fast system.
